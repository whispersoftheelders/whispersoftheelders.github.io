                <h3>What do we believe in?</h3>
                <p>We have a few key tenets that we adhere to. These tenets include:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Following the cyclical nature of the world and universe</li>
                    <li>Belief in the metaphysical</li>
                    <li>Belief in the infinite</li>
                    <li>Acting in accordance with our 'Book of Conduct'</li>

    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="third-box">
            <h4>Why do you believe in such things?</h4>
            <p>There are many such reasons.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Firstly, in reference to the first point, we live in a world where everything is cyclical. The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning. Whether you choose to believe so is, of course, completely up to the individual. However, in order to join the order of WOTE, you must adhere to this belief.</p>

    <section class="where">
        <div class="where-box">
            <h5>Where are we based?</h5>
            <p>We are currently based in Melbourne, Australia. However, that is likely to change in the future. Our membership is not limited to Australia, and we encourage curious minds across the globe to enquire about our order.</p>
